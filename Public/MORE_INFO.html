	<h1>California Roll</h1>
	This California roll includes real crabmeat, creamy avocado and crunchy cucumber rolled inside-out on a bed of sushi rice.
	<div>
		<ul> 
			<li><u>Prep Time: 20minutes</u></li>
			<li><u>Ingredients</u></li>
			<li>1 batch sushi rice</li>
			<li>1  avocado sliced into strips</li>
			<li>9.17 ounces crabmeat</li>
			<li>1  cucumber - hot house seeds removed with a spoon and julienned</li>
			<li>1 pack unseasoned nori</li>
			<li>sesame seeds - whole, toasted</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div> 
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<p>1.Prepare a batch of sushi rice.<br>
			2.Because a California Roll gets rolled inside out, you need to cover your makisu (bamboo mat) with plastic wrap to keep the rice from sticking to the mat. You'll also want to prepare a small bowl of water to dip your fingers in to keep the rice from sticking to them.<br>
			3.Carefully fold your nori in half, if the nori is fresh, it should split in half along the fold to give you two 3.75 inch x 8 inch pieces. If your nori is stale and refusing to split, you can toast it by gently waving it over an open flame, or simply use a pair of scissors.<br>
			4.Lay one sheet of nori towards the bottom of the mat. Lightly wet your fingers in the bowl of water and top with a small amount of rice.<br>
			5.Making sure your fingers are moist to prevent the rice from sticking, use your fingertips to gently spread the rice out to the edges of the nori in a thin even layer. Don't use too much pressure, or you'll end up with mushy rice.<br>
			6.Sprinkle the rice with sesame seeds, then flip the rice and nori over so that the rice is on the bottom and the nori is facing up.
			7.Along the bottom edge of the nori, put a few strips of cucumber down, followed by a few strips of avocado. Finish, by spreading some crabmeat across the roll. Be careful not to add too much filling or your roll won't seal properly.<br>
			8.To roll, tuck your thumbs under the bamboo mat and use them to lift the mat and rice over the filling, while using the rest of your fingers to hold the filling in place.<br>
			9.Use the mat to continue rolling the rice over the filling until the rice hits the nori.<br>
			10.At this point you'll probably need to start pealing the mat back away as you continue to roll, otherwise you'll end up rolling the mat into the rice.<br>
			11.Once, the rice has been completely rolled into a cylinder. Give the matt a firm hug with your fingers to compress the rice a little so it doesn't fall apart when you cut it.<br>
			12.If you're not going to eat the roll right away, wrap it in plastic wrap until you are ready to eat your California Roll. Putting the rolls in the refrigerator will make the rice hard and is not recommended, but if it's going to be more than an hour before you're going to eat the roll, you should put it in the fridge to keep the crab from spoiling.<br>
			13.To slice the rolls, use a long sharp knife, and place the back edge of the blade at the very center of the roll. Pull the knife towards you, letting the weight of the knife cut through the roll. If put pressure on the knife, it will squish the roll and the filling will come out. Repeat cutting each half into thirds to make 6 pieces of sushi.<br>
			14.Serve your California roll with soy sauce and wasabi.<br>

		<h1>Philadelphia Roll</h1> 
		<div>
			<ul> 
				<li><u>Prep Time: 20minutes</u></li>
				<li><u>Ingredients</u></li>
				<li>1 cup sushi rice</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar</li>
				<li>1 sheet nori (seaweed paper)</li>
				<li>1 1⁄2 ounces smoked salmon</li>
				<li>1⁄2 small cucumber</li>
				<li>2 tablespoons cream cheese</li>
		    </ul>
		</div>

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<div>

			1.Use "Sushi Rice" only, also knows as "Kagayaki" or"Koshihikari" rice.<br>
			2.Put rice in a bowl and fill with water you will notice the water is cloudy. Drain water out and repeat the process until the water is clear.<br>
			3.Bring 1 cup of rice and 1 cup of water to a boil.<br>
			4.Reduce to a simmer and cover.<br>
			5.Cook about 15minutes. Just until all the water is adsorbed, could be more or less time. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.<br>
			5.Remove the rice from the heat and let sit, still covered, for 10min.<br>
			6.Spread rice on a flat surface. You want it to spread out as much as possible to cool quickly.<br>
			7.Sprinkle on 1 Tbs of SEASONED Rice Vinegar.<br>
			8.If you have just "Rice Vinegar" combine 1Tbs Vinegar with 1Tbs Sugar and 1tsp Salt and it is the same thing. Put mixture over heat in a sauce pan or in the microwave to dissolve sugar and salt.<br>
			9.Work vinegar through rice by pushing around with a spoon, also start fanning your rice. You want the rice to cool as quickly as possible.<br>
			10.The rice should have a sheen all over, if it does not add a little more vinegar.<br>
			11.Wet your hands and form the rice into a ball, it should stick together and still pull apart into individual pieces.<br>
			12.Place a piece of plastic wrap on your bamboo mat and put Nori on top of it with the rough side up.<br>
			13.Spread out 3/4 to 1 cup of cooked rice per sheet of Nori (seaweed paper). Use wet hands and spread around the whole sheet leaving a 1 inch border on the bottom.<br>
			14.Turn the sheet over so the rice is facing the plastic wrap and the nori with nothing on it is facing up. Make sure the 1inch rice free border is on the bottom.<br>
			15.1/3 of the way up from the bottom smear a line of cream cheese.<br>
			16.Place Salmon on top of the cream cheese.<br>
			17.Cut Cucumber into small strips and lay beside the Salmon.<br>
			18.Fold the bottom of the sheet over the rice and continue rolling into a log.<br>
			19.Cut with a wet serrated blade.<br>

				<h1>Seattle Roll</h1> 
		
				<div>
					<ul> 
						<li><u>Prep Time: 20minutes,  makes about 32 rolls</u></li>
						<li><u>Ingredients</u></li>
						<li>1-3/4 cups rice (300 g or 10.5 ounces)</li>
						<li>1/3 cup rice vinegar (80 ml)</li>
						<li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
						<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
						<li>1 English cucumber</li>
						<li>container of cream cheese</li>
						<li>4 sheets of sushi nori</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
					<h2>Instructions</h2>

					<div> 

					1.Wash the rice in cold water until the water is clear. Usually I just wash the rice in the rice cooker bowl, draining it using a colander. It will take a few rounds of this.<br>
					2.When the water is clear, add fresh water and let the rice soak for 3-4 hours.<br>
					3.Cook in the rice cooker, or if you need to use a stove, according to the instructions on the rice packaging. (I’m sorry I can’t be more help in this department – I usually make rice in the rice cooker so measurements – besides the ‘knuckle’ measurement – are beyond me.)<br>
					4.Stir the vinegar, salt and sugar together until the sugar and salt dissolve.<br>
					5.Scoop the hot rice out onto a flat pan or serving dish. Pour the vinegar mixture over it. Using a rice paddle or spatula, stir the mixture into the rice until it is all absorbed, while fanning the whole thing with a piece of paper until there’s no more steam coming off the rice. By fanning it, you cool the rice as it absorbs the mixture, and also keeps the rice shiny. Cover with plastic wrap and let it cool entirely.<br>
					6.Cut the cucumber to the length of the nori sheets. Cut in half and scoop out the seeds. Cut each half into 4 pieces.<br>
					7.Place the nori on a sushi mat. Spread the rice evenly over the mat, leaving a half-inch at the top and the bottom of the nori that will not be covered in rice. At the end of the nori closest to you, place one piece of cucumber, and an amount of salmon the same width as the cucumber pieces. Next to the salmon spread an amount of cream cheese about the width of the salmon.<br>
					8.Using the sushi mat, roll the sushi starting with the end with all the ingredients. Roll tightly.<br>
					9.Cut the sushi roll into 8 pieces. Repeat for the rest of the nori sheets.<br>
